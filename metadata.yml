Title: Antimicrobial activity prediction test
Description: Prediction of clinically relevant drug-induced-liver-injury (DILI), based solely on drug structure using binary classification methods. The authors collected a public dataset of 475 molecules with associated DILI outcomes, and built a model with an accuracy of 0.89. The model checkpoints have not been provided so Ersilia has used the provided data to retrain the model.
Mode: Pretrained
Task: Classification
Input: Compound
Input Shape: Single
Output: Float
Output Type: Float
Output Shape: List
Interpretation: This model does not do anything. It is just mock model
